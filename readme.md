# Tic Tac Toe Multiplayer

A real-time multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game where two players join using a unique game ID. The backend uses **Node.js** and **Socket.IO** to handle communication between players.

## Features

- **Two-player game**: Players join a game using a unique `gameID`.
- **Turn-based gameplay**: Player 1 enters 'O' and Player 2 enters 'X' on their turn.
- **Real-time updates**: The game updates in real-time as players make their moves.
- **Game ID**: Each game session is identified by a unique `gameID`, allowing two players to join and play together.
- **Socket.IO communication**: The server listens for player actions and sends updates to both players using Socket.IO.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building the backend server.
- **Socket.IO**: A library for real-time communication between the backend and the playersâ€™ browsers.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building the user interface of the game.

   - Player 1 will enter 'O' on their turn.
   - Player 2 will enter 'X' on their turn.

2. Player 2 joins the same game with the same `gameID`.
3. Player 1 makes a move by selecting a cell to place 'O'.
4. Player 2 makes a move by selecting a cell to place 'X'.
5. The game continues until one player wins or it ends in a draw.
